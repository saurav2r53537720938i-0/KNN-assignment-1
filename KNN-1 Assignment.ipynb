    "The K-Nearest neighbour(KNN) algorthim is a simple supervised machine learning algorthim used for classfication and regression tasks.it classfies or predict a new data point's label based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbour in the feature space.The choice of K determines the number of neighbour to consider.It is a non-parmetric,lazy learning algorthim meaning it doesn't make any assumption about the underlying data distribution and doesn't require traning a model before making predctions"
